# TopographicalMapsProject

A program which parses through a CSV database of topographical maps of various locations around the USA and plots the terrain onto a 3D plane

Uses:
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Numpy

Still a WIP

First run "python3 utils.py init" and then "python3 utils.py clean" at the root of the project to purge any unnecessary files

Then run "python3 runner.py" in order to run the project
